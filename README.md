## About
Slack Metal is a dark theme for the Slack Mac app. It is designed to put less strain on your eyes and to blend in seamlessly with the macOS Dark Mode. 

This project was born from a method provided by @laCour (https://github.com/laCour/slack-night-mode/issues/73#issuecomment-287467332)

Disclaimer: this is a hack â€“ use it at your own peril! (the CSS-file is a beautiful mess...)
